This guide explains how to use Content Gravity SEO to improve content quality and internal linking structure on your WordPress site.

1. Getting Started

After activating the plugin, navigate to:

WordPress Admin → Content Gravity

You do not need to configure any settings before using the plugin.
The Content Analyzer works out of the box.

The Overview page provides a high-level summary of your site’s SEO health.

You may see:

Average content optimization score

Number of weak or under-optimized posts

Internal link statistics

Link authority (Link Juice) distribution

This page is designed to help you decide what to optimize first, not to replace detailed analysis.

3. Content Analyzer (Main Workflow)

The Content Analyzer is the primary workspace of the plugin.

Content Gravity → Content Analyzer

You will see a table listing all posts and pages with:

Word count

Internal link count

Optimization status

Use this list to quickly identify weak or under-optimized content.

Click Optimize on any post to open the Optimization Workspace.

4. Optimization Workspace (Single Post)

This page is where most optimization work happens.

4.1 Metrics Sidebar

The sidebar displays:

Overall optimization score

Word count

Heading structure (H2 / H3 usage)

Readability (approximate)

Link summary

These metrics update when the content is refreshed or reanalyzed.

4.2 Focus Keywords

You can define one or more focus keywords for the post.

The analyzer checks whether these keywords appear in:

Title

Headings

Content body

This helps guide on-page optimization.

4.3 Optimization Checklist

The Optimization Checklist (Live) shows:

Completed SEO elements

Missing or weak elements

Examples:

Missing internal links

Low word count

Poor heading structure

This checklist is advisory and does not modify content automatically.

5. Internal Link Opportunities

Inside the Optimization Workspace, you may see an Internal Link Opportunities panel.

What this does

Suggests relevant internal pages you can link to

Suggestions are based on relevance and internal authority

No links are inserted automatically without confirmation

Inserting a link

Click Preview Link to review the suggestion

Click Insert Link to add it to the content

Editor compatibility

✅ Classic Editor

✅ Gutenberg (Block Editor)

❌ Elementor (automatic insertion disabled)

When Elementor content is detected, the plugin shows a notice and disables automatic insertion to prevent layout issues.

6. Internal Linking Overview

Go to:

Content Gravity → Internal Linking

Here you can:

Scan internal links across the site

Recalculate internal authority scores

View orphan pages (no incoming links)

View low-authority pages

Orphan Pages

Pages with zero internal incoming links.
These pages are often invisible to internal navigation and should be linked.

Low Authority Pages

Pages with few or weak internal links.
They may benefit from links from stronger pages.

7. Link Juice (Internal Authority)

Link Juice is an internal authority estimation metric.

What it represents

How internal links distribute authority across your site

Inspired by PageRank-style calculations

What it is NOT

It is not a Google ranking signal

It does not guarantee ranking improvements

Use Link Juice as guidance, not as an absolute metric.

8. Table of Contents (TOC)

Content Gravity can automatically generate a Table of Contents for posts.

Features
